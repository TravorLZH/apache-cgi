# Apache CGI Demonstrations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TravorLZH/apache-cgi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TravorLZH/apache-cgi)

This repo is originally for backup my code because I need to change a new computer, but later I found it is not only a backup, but also sharing my code. I release it to public domain because it is education purpose. You can make it your program as well.

## libcgi: Tiny CGI library used by my program

* **URL Decoding**: Decode characters from URL encoding

* **Query String Analysis**: Get variable's value from query string

## Programs

* **hello**: Displays "Hello world!", that's it

* **readvar**: It reads the value of 'hello' from the query string

* **viewsource**: This program is supposed to work with `mod_rewrite`, so that I can use it to highlight `*.c` source files
